# DIY Humanoid Robot Showcase

## Project Overview
This repository provides an overview of my DIY humanoid robot head project, which I completed in 2023. The robot is built using 3D-printed parts from the InMoov website, powered by an Arduino, and controlled with a custom AI that responds to voice commands.

## Features
- **3D Printed Humanoid Head**: Assembled using parts from InMoov.
- **Servo Motors**: Control eye and mouth movements.
- **Bluetooth Speaker Integration**: Outputs audio responses.
- **Custom AI Code**: Includes features like weather updates, alarms, voice commands, application control, and more.
- **Voice-Controlled Servo Motor**: Controls servo motor movements via voice commands.

## Project Details
### Hardware Components
- 3D Printed Parts: Sourced from the InMoov website
- Arduino Board
- Servo Motors
- Bluetooth Speaker
- Power Bank

### Software Components
- AI Code: Python-based AI with pre-programmed commands
- Speech Recognition: Google Speech Recognition API
- Text-to-Speech: pyttsx3 library
- Weather Information: OpenWeatherMap API
- Advanced Queries: WolframAlpha API

## Installation and Setup
Since the code is not included in this repository, here are the general steps I followed to set up the project:
1. **Hardware Assembly**:
   - Assemble the 3D-printed parts according to the InMoov instructions.
   - Connect the servo motors to the Arduino board.
   - Integrate the Bluetooth speaker inside the robot head.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Write the Python code to control the servos and integrate APIs for voice recognition, weather updates, etc.
   - Establish a serial connection between the Python AI and the Arduino for command transfer.

## Usage
- **Voice Commands**: Control the robot using voice commands for various functionalities.
- **Dynamic Responses**: The AI responds with various pre-programmed answers for different queries.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding more advanced AI features
- Integrating additional sensors for enhanced interaction
- Improving the physical design with more 3D-printed parts
